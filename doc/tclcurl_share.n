.SH DESCRIPTION

With the share API, you can have two or more 'easy' handles sharing data
among them, so far they can only share cookies and DNS data.

.SH curl::shareinit
This procedure must be the first one to call, it returns a \fBshareHandle\fP
that you need to use to share data among handles using the \fB-share\fP option
to the \fBconfigure\fP command. The init MUST have a corresponding call to
\fBcleanup\fP when the operation is completed.

.B RETURN VALUE
.sp
\fBshareHandle\fP to use.

.SH shareHandle share ?data?

The parameter specifies a type of data that should be shared. This may be set
to one of the values described below:

.RS
.TP 5
.B cookies
Cookie data will be shared across the easy handles using this shared object.

.TP
.B dns
Cached DNS hosts will be shared across the easy handles using this shared object.
Note that when you use the multi interface, all easy handles added to the same multi
handle will share DNS cache by default without this having to be used!
.RE

.SH shareHandle unshare ?data?
This command does the opposite of \fBshare\fP. The specified parameter will no
longer be shared. Valid values are the same as those for \fBshare\fP.

.SH sharehandle cleanup

Deletes a shared object. The share handle cannot be used anymore after this
function has been called.

.SH curl::sharestrerror errorCode
Returns a string describing the error code passed in the argument.
